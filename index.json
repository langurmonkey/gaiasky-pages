This has been done to match the domain of our new website gaiasky.space. Additionally, this has enabled us to verify the application, which was impossible with the old de.uni_heidelberg.zah.GaiaSky ID, as we did not control that domain.\nGaia Sky is now veryfied on Flathub. Essentially, I needed to contact the uni-heidelberg.de domain owner and ask them to add their domain to a PSL (public suffix list). They were initially cooperative, but after a few department redirections my requests must have fallen down the bureaucracy cracks, for they stopped being responsive. If you want the full story, check out this issue, and this one.\nAnyway, creating a proper website for Gaia Sky was already on the to-do list.

Use busy wait to lock to the perfect target FPS, when active. add maximum allowed distance as a hard limit, set at 50 Gpc, roughly twice the size of the observable universe. top info interface date and time elements are clickable, and display the date/time edit dialog. migrate VR version to OpenXR API. add arbitrary warping mesh support to distor the final image according to a warping mesh file in PFM (portable float map) format. replace lens flare checkbox with lens flare strength slider. enable choosing the lens flare type (pseudo lens flare, real lens flare) in the settings. Make new lens flare the default. proper lens flare post-processing effect. add maximum number of virtual texture tile load operations per frame to settings file, and increase its default value from 3 to 8. Use a deque instead of a queue for the tiles waiting to be loaded, and add the newly observed tiles to the head instead of the tail. increase chromatic aberration amount in lens flare effect. add variations of API calls concerning positions using the distance units as an extra parameter. move archetypes definition to JSON file to facilitate the automatic generation of documentation. move attribute map definition to JSON file, which contains the definitions of all the attributes per component, and also a description for each of them. The aim is to generate part of the data format documentation from this JSON file. enable implementing body coordinates directly from Python scripts. Add new API calls and a full script example with data files. expose upscale filter setting to UI via a select box in the preferences window. add chromatic aberration shader, together with a slider in the preferences window to disable it or control the amount. enable proper motion for single particles, fix issues with tracking. add support for ambient occlusion sampler (standalone and with metallic and roughness channels) in PBR normal and tessellation shaders. add (partial) support for glTF, binary glTF and embedded glTF. add (hidden) attribute \u0026ldquo;renderParticles\u0026rdquo; to star and particle sets to disable the rendering of particles and stars for that set. add aliases to label position for pc and Km, remove unnecessary operations from shape updater. add keyboard mapping and action to multiply the camera movement speed (mapped to \u0026lsquo;Z\u0026rsquo; by default). add actions and key bindings to toggle the camera mode and the cinematic behaviour. support translation in Km with the \u0026rsquo;translateKm\u0026rsquo; attribute. directly support archetype names in JSON data format, additionally to the legacy class names. enable affine transformation support for shape objects. support \u0026lsquo;standard\u0026rsquo; PBR attributes in OBJ loader. add warp mesh file selector to preferences, to select the warping mesh for the new spherical mirror projection. Fix layout for file choosers in frame and screenshot locations. add support for the spherical mirror projection in planetarium mode. add upscale filter setting to preferences, add XBRZ upscale shader, filter and effect. non user-prompted events (download fail, checkum error, etc.) create persistent notifications which need to be closed manually. Persistent notifications are accompanied with a close button to indicate they need to be closed manually. add parallax demo script. separate height scale from elevation multiplier in shaders. Decrease step of some sliders. enable arbitrary parameter map injection in data loaders. add fadeDistanceUp and fadeDistanceDown to trajectory objects to control the fading distances when a body is present. add animations to all UI elements, add animation time to settings. add in/out animations to gamepad GUI and maximize/minimize to debug and focus interfaces. Add animation time as a new setting in settings file. Promote date dialog to generic dialog. add size attribute to ray-marching effects, enable absolute predicted positions for ray-marching effects, instead of only a static position. add per-vertex colors (instead of per-segment) to polyline quadstrip renderer for smooth shading. add shortcut to settings in context menu. more on input. first OpenXR test, not working on Linux over SteamVR due to unsupported swapchain formats. add ambient level and color to individual models. add \u0026lsquo;fixed angular size\u0026rsquo; support for star datasets. It renders all stars with a fixed angular size. In the case of variable stars, if a fixed angular size is set, the variability is expressed via the opacity. Bug Fixes correctly initialize camera focus and mode at gamepad/VR GUI creation. restore functionality in archive/DB information window when selecting stars. restore functionality of location log, lost in a regression during the ECS refactoring. star set labels respect label fading factor. move Gaia Sky logo over the title in help window. \u0026lsquo;cancel download\u0026rsquo; catalan and spanish translation texts. roughness and metallic colors and textures not being set correctly in wavefront loader. look-up table paths in procedural generation window. regression in go-to command with star and particle groups. check for empty configuration file at startup and overwrite it if necessary. orientation locking does not work in backwards time. Fixes #718. bump default safe mode OpenGL version to 3.3 to support instancing. GPUs from 2007 support it, so it should be safe. Also, do not attempt to compile double-precision geometry shaders in safe mode, since they are not used and may crash anyways. line trail mapping in non-timestamped trajectories. Fixes #715. double-rebuilding of dataset manager on close. Also, closing the dataset manager does not persist the preferences. shader version for normal shader from 410 to 330 to prevent crashes in old GPUs. regression in texture binding introduced in 3.5.0-RC3 (commit 7db456cc). adjust rotate/turn strength when using the arrow keys. random bugs in label render system. do not show collapse/expand buttons in collapsible windows if collapsing is disabled. wrong key used in galactic latitude attribute in color map picker. input multiplexer and welcome GUI initialization sequence may cause a startup crash in certain conditions. initialization sequence for distance scale factor, and particle groups breaking in VR when using triangles. do not skip processing of LOD-based object when it is the current camera focus. adjust visibility and opacity determination for entities with active fade in map; mostly used for NEARGALCAT objects. spread GPU streaming of multi-component billboard datasets over several frames. billboard set texture array uniform setting. pixel-perfect interaction in VR menus. Surface normal was being transformed with a matrix that contained a translation instead of only using rotations. properly scale particle set particles in VR. proper motions in VR mode. interactive load of JSON datasets that contain objects with 3D models blocks main thread. guard in getLineObject() calls with a timeout does not use the time out. Fixes #711. scale orbit element particles for VR, readjust size limits. slider texture filtering issue in green, blue, orange and red themes. star surface shader crash when motion blur is on. non-canonical OpenGL parameters in some configuration calls. headless mode crashes on start. star billboard and quad positions in stereo mode. absolute position method in particle set does not guard against null parameters. Fixes #710. dataset manager layout, especially on low-resolution displays. move hardcoded billboard galaxy threshold to model initializer. single star rendering from afar, spherical position determination, graph update sequence for proper motion and other objects, bypass area and loc update when components are off, camera position lock for stars in star sets. several issues with single star rendering and magnitude initialization. add mechanism to automatically disable certain post-processing effects on certain render modes (e.g. light glow on panorama/planetarium mode). internal dataset loading operations out of order: move scene graph insertion before set-up. enable model-less shape objects for label-only use cases. removing objects with children only effectively removes the first children, leaving orphan objects in the scene graph which do not get updated but get added to the render lists. removal of an object from the graph does not remove its children. normals, bi-normals and tangents in icosphere creator. crash with static light models, file filter in dataset loader. cloud virtual textures not working due to missing shader attribute. crash loading wrongly constructed cluster file. trail attribute of orbits not always working. GPU non-trail orbits not working. Performance Improvements improve performance of velocity vectors in LOD datasets by setting restrictions on the octant\u0026rsquo;s solid angle before sending the star sets to the velocity vector renderer. remove guard clauses in shader interpolation function that are already covered by smoothstep(). distribute SVT render pass over 5 frames to split contribution over time and achieve more or less constant frame pacing. Code Refactoring set \u0026lsquo;useColor\u0026rsquo; in models to false by default, so that the object color is not passed to the 3D model unless explicitly stated. remove dpendency on gdx-gltf, implement own modification which directly loads meshes using 32-bit integer indices instead of 16-bit shorts. rename some classes to make them more concise. Fix and improve javadoc comments. consolidate shader and resource disposing in post processors. unify tessellation and regular shader infrastructure. trigger star/particle set update task in updater systems instead of via the camera motion event. Shorten minimum times between metadata updates. move particle and star set updater methods to consumers initialized at creation. rename all math utilities converted from single to double precision from [name]d to [name]Double. use solid angle component instead of hardcoded variables for star cluster thresholds. move \u0026lsquo;forceLabel\u0026rsquo; attribute to Label component.

Features enable minimizing focus info interface. adjust debug interface layout. key bindings file versioning. If the key bindings file starts with the line #v[version], that version is compared to the default one and overwritten when necessary. That makes updating key bindings much easier. recompute UI scale at startup when starting with default config file. add back-buffer scale API call. add back-buffer scale controls to UI. add repository to -v information. rename fisheye post-processing effect and shader to reprojection. Update cubemap projection from fisheye to azimuthal equidistant. add shaders for Lambert equal-area, orthographic and stereographic projections. add re-projection GUI drop-down in preferences window.

This flag causes the label of the object to always be rendered, regardless of the solid angle and other constraints. The flag is controlled by new button at the top of the focus information pane (bottom-right) and via two new scripting API calls. new API call: setDatasetPointSizeMultiplier(String, Double). new non-constant-density fog shader which approximates physical fog much better than before. planet generation with elevation, diffuse and specular textures. redesign dataset manager. The old download manager/catalog selection duo is phased out in favor of the new dataset manager. This is more usable and less confusing, while allowing for parallel downloads. save session log file to. screen space reflections Merge branch \u0026lsquo;ssr\u0026rsquo;. shapes (spheres, cones, cylinders, etc.) of arbitrary sizes can now be added around any object, with the possibility of tracking the object\u0026rsquo;s size. This is an extension of #378 which includes many more options plus an API entry point. show release notes at startup after a version update. simplify loading mechanism by joining catalog files with object files. No distinction is necessary anymore, for all of them work in the same way and are loaded by the same entities. update splash. update welcome GUI background image. updated the Bulgarian translation. Bug Fixes \u0026lsquo;add scene graph object\u0026rsquo; event missing source object. Fixes #400. Gaia fov modes with triangle-based stars. JSON output of REST API server. VR controller info positioning, settings crash. add default values for orbit line and point colors. add notice whenever a default-data update is available. add null-checks for some OpenVR properties (required by Oculus 2).

The CNS5 is compiled based on trigonometric parallaxes from Gaia EDR3 and Hipparcos, and supplemented with astrometric data from Spitzer and ground-based surveys carried out in the infrared. The CNS5 catalogue is statistically complete down to 19.7 mag in G-band and 11.8 mag in W1-band absolute magnitudes, corresponding to a spectral type of L8. Continuous updates of observational data for nearby stars from all sources were collected and evaluated. For all known stars in the 25 pc sphere around the Sun, the best values of positions in space, velocities, and magnitudes in different filters are presented.

This table contains an all-sky catalog of 869 nearby galaxies having individual distance estimates within 11 Mpc or corrected radial velocities relative to the Local Group centroid VLG \u003c 600 km s-1. The catalog is a renewed and expanded version of the previous Catalog of Neighboring Galaxies by Karachentsev et al. (2004, AJ, 127, 2031). It collects data on the following galaxy observables: angular diameters, apparent magnitudes in the far-UV, B, and Ks bands, H-alpha and H I fluxes, morphological types, H I-line widths, radial velocities, and distance estimates. In this Local Volume (LV) sample, 108 dwarf galaxies still remain without measured radial velocities. The catalog also lists calculated global galaxy parameters: the linear Holmberg diameters, absolute B magnitudes, surface brightnesses, H I masses, stellar masses estimated via K-band luminosity, H I rotational velocities corrected for galaxy inclination, indicative masses within the Holmberg radius, and three kinds of 'tidal index' which quantify the local density environment. In the reference paper, the authors briefly discuss the Hubble flow within the LV and different scaling relations that characterize galaxy structure and global star formation in them. They also trace the behavior of the mean stellar mass density, H I-mass density, and star formation rate density within the volume considered.

This dataset contains all planet and host star solutions, regardless of their relationship. This includes atypical systems such as free-floating planets and those with multiple stars. This table also contains Kepler, K2, and TESS candidate solutions for confirmed planet systems, a nearly complete identification of published stellar companions, and projected and true planet obliquities. The systems in this dataset are shown with glyphs according to the number of planets in the system, and colored accordingly. When approaching a system, the glyph disappears and the actual stars and planets get loaded. Note that this dataset also includes the stars as defined in the NASA Exoplanet Archive, so if you already have a star catalog you will end up with duplicate objects.

Euclid is an ESA mission to map the geometry of the Universe and better understand the mysterious dark matter and dark energy, which make up most of the energy budget of the cosmos. The mission will investigate the distance-redshift relationship and the evolution of cosmic structures by measuring shapes and redshifts of galaxies and clusters of galaxies out to redshifts ~2, or equivalently to a look-back time of 10 billion years. In this way, Euclid will cover the entire period over which dark energy played a significant role in accelerating the expansion of the Universe.
