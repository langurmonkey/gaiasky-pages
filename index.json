As of the latest update, location bookmarks are no longer limited to just camera position, orientation, and time. Now, they can also store the full settings file and the focus object — giving you a complete snapshot of your session. Additionally, on creation the user may choose what elements to persist as part of the bookmark.\nThis means that when you load a bookmark, Gaia Sky can restore not only where you were, but also how things were configured and what object you were focused on. Whether you’re setting up a custom visualization, preparing a presentation, or just exploring the cosmos, your environment can now be fully restored with a single click.\nWhat’s more: all bookmark fields (except for the name) are now optional — you can selectively store in your bookmark only what matters to you.\nThe new location bookmark dialog allows for the selection of the elements to persist. To learn more, check out the Bookmarks documentation.\nThe new feature will make it into the next Gaia Sky release. As always, you can already test it by running Gaia Sky from source.\n","href":"https://gaiasky.space/news/2025/new-bookmarks/","tags":["bookmarks","session","focus","settings"],"title":"New features in bookmarks"},{"categories":["devlog"],"content":"One of the items in our roadmap has long been the re-implementation of the speed scaling algorithm. This algorithm is a function that, given the current state of Gaia Sky, returns a number by which to scale the camera speed.\nSo far, we have used a pure function that only takes into account the distance to the focus object when the camera is in focus mode, or the distance to the closest object to the camera when it is in any other mode. This does not work very well in many situations. In this post, I explore the new developments in Gaia Sky that enable smoother interstellar trips by means of the camera speed scaling.\nThe problem The main issue with the current method is that its only dependency on the distance to the focus object makes it ignore all the (possibly closer to the camera) objects. We compute it like this, $$ d_s = d_f * K, $$\nwhere \\(d_s\\) is the distance scale, \\(d_f\\) is the distance to the focus, and \\(K\\) is a constant.\nPicture this: we are focused on Phobos in the Solar System, and the moon is in full view of our camera. In the background we spot an interesting star. We double-click on it to focus it, and then we click on the \u0026ldquo;Go to\u0026rdquo; button in the focus pane. With the current implementation, Phobos, Mars, and the entirety of the Solar System disappear in the first frame, because the first step towards our star focus is too large. This is because we are very far away from the star, and the speed scaling only depends on this distance. The speed is set to very high, so we are instantly thrown out of the Solar System.\nThe problem with the current speed scaling. Note how the first frame is already well outside the Solar System. How do we solve this?\nThe solution The first obvious solution is to take into account objects other than the focus. One possible solution is to compute the local density of objects in an arbitrary volume around the camera, but this is probably overkill. Another solution might be setting up the closest object to the camera with a smoothing radius, and mix its distance with that of the focus:\n\\begin{aligned} d_s \u0026amp; = mix(d_c, d_f, a) \\\\ a \u0026amp; = \\frac{d_c - d_0}{d_1 - d_0}, \\end{aligned}\nwhere \\(d_c\\) is the distance to the closest object, and \\(d_0\\) and \\(d_1\\) define the smoothing radius outer and inner bounds. When the camera is further away from the closest object than \\(d_1\\), only the focus distance is used. When the camera is closer to the object than \\(d_0\\), only the distance to the closest object is use. In between the two smoothing distances, a mix of both is used.\nThe smoothing radius (in red and green) provides a smooth transition between using the distance to the focus and the distance to the closest object. This method gives us a rather smooth transition from object to object. The camera is usually hooked to a single object, which may be the focus or the closest object. In the case that the camera is between \\(d_0\\) and \\(d_1\\) from the closest object, we mix the contributions to avoid stark transitions in speed.\nThe video below compares the old and the new methods:\nYour browser does not support the video tag. Comparison between the old method, based on focus distance, and the new method, that takes into account other objects. Transition-based trips The Gaia Sky API contains some methods to create frame-accurate camera transitions in both position and orientation. Those are smooth by design, as they can use logit and logistic sigmoid mapping functions.\nThese methods interpolate the camera state (position, direction, and up vectors) from the current state to a user-defined final state. They do so in a provided amount of time, and using the provided mapping function. They end up calling something like this:\nvoid cameraTransition(double[] camPos, String units, double[] camDir, double[] camUp, double positionDurationSeconds, String positionSmoothType, double positionSmoothFactor, double orientationDurationSeconds, String orientationSmoothType, double orientationSmoothFactor, boolean sync) Here is the documentation. For completion, the parameters are as follows:\ncamPos \u0026ndash; final camera position. units \u0026ndash; final camera position units. camDir \u0026ndash; final camera direction vector. camUp \u0026ndash; final camera up vector. positionDurationSeconds \u0026ndash; duration of transition in position, in seconds. positionSmoothType \u0026ndash; mapping function, either \u0026ldquo;logisticsigmoid\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;logit\u0026rdquo;. positionSmoothFactor \u0026ndash; smoothing factor for the mapping function. orientationDurationSeconds \u0026ndash; duration of the transition in orientation, in seconds. orientationSmoothType \u0026ndash; mapping function, either \u0026ldquo;logisticsigmoid\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;logit\u0026rdquo;. orientationSmoothFactor \u0026ndash; smoothing factor for the mapping function. sync \u0026ndash; whether to run in synchronous mode, or return immediately and run asynchronously. Smooth go-to-object API call Since we already have the goToObject(name) API call, which uses the regular speed scaling-based method described in the previous sections, I thought I would take advantage of the already implemented transitions and spin up a better go-to. I called it goToObjectSmooth(name, posDuration, orientationDuration) [API reference]. This method uses camera transitions internally, and produces a fundamentally different result than its plain goToObject() counterpart. I happen to think that produces better results in most cases.\nHere is a comparison video with both methods.\nYour browser does not support the video tag. The new goToObjectSmooth() API call produces a more pleasant trip from start to finish.

The CNS5 is compiled based on trigonometric parallaxes from Gaia EDR3 and Hipparcos, and supplemented with astrometric data from Spitzer and ground-based surveys carried out in the infrared. The CNS5 catalogue is statistically complete down to 19.7 mag in G-band and 11.8 mag in W1-band absolute magnitudes, corresponding to a spectral type of L8. Continuous updates of observational data for nearby stars from all sources were collected and evaluated. For all known stars in the 25 pc sphere around the Sun, the best values of positions in space, velocities, and magnitudes in different filters are presented.

This table contains an all-sky catalog of 869 nearby galaxies having individual distance estimates within 11 Mpc or corrected radial velocities relative to the Local Group centroid VLG \u003c 600 km s-1. The catalog is a renewed and expanded version of the previous Catalog of Neighboring Galaxies by Karachentsev et al. (2004, AJ, 127, 2031). It collects data on the following galaxy observables: angular diameters, apparent magnitudes in the far-UV, B, and Ks bands, H-alpha and H I fluxes, morphological types, H I-line widths, radial velocities, and distance estimates. In this Local Volume (LV) sample, 108 dwarf galaxies still remain without measured radial velocities. The catalog also lists calculated global galaxy parameters: the linear Holmberg diameters, absolute B magnitudes, surface brightnesses, H I masses, stellar masses estimated via K-band luminosity, H I rotational velocities corrected for galaxy inclination, indicative masses within the Holmberg radius, and three kinds of 'tidal index' which quantify the local density environment. In the reference paper, the authors briefly discuss the Hubble flow within the LV and different scaling relations that characterize galaxy structure and global star formation in them. They also trace the behavior of the mean stellar mass density, H I-mass density, and star formation rate density within the volume considered.

Type: virtualtex-pack Dataset version: v0 Minimum Gaia Sky version: 3.4.0 Size: 2.7GiB (2938258080) Number of objects: 1 (1) Dataset files Dataset information/source 8K Moon topography VT (LRO WAC DTM) vt-moon-topography-lro 8K Moon topography virtual texture (LRO WAC DTM). The WAC Digital Terrain Model was derived from WAC observations, and covers 98.2% of the lunar surface. Using digital photogrammetric techniques, the GLD100 was computed from 69,000 WAC stereo models. Due to persistent shadows near the poles it is not possible to create a complete WAC stereo map at the very highest latitudes. Type: virtualtex-pack Dataset version: v0 Minimum Gaia Sky version: 3.4.0 Size: 8.4MiB (8802327) Number of objects: 1 (1) Dataset files Dataset information/source 32K Moon topography NASA (SVS, DEM LRO:LOLA) vt-moon-topography-nasa 32K Moon topography virtual texture (NASA Scientific Visualization Studio, dataset: DEM LRO:LOLA). he displacement map (also known as a height map or elevation map) was taken directly from the latest (as of spring 2019) gridded data products of the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter instrument team. LOLA data is archived on the Geosciences Node of the Planetary Data System. A small subset of the LOLA data stored there, the global cylindrical projections at 4, 16, and 64 pixels per degree, has been reformatted here as uncompressed TIFF files, in vertical units of either floating-point kilometers or 16-bit unsigned integer half-meters. The reference surface for all LRO data is a sphere of radius 1737.4 km. LOLA's gridded elevation data is published as signed 16-bit integers in units of half-meters relative to this radius. For the floating-point TIFFs, the source data was divided by 2000. For the unsigned 16-bit TIFFs, the source data was offset by +20,000 (10 km) so that all of the values are positive. This latter format is provided for software that doesn't work well with either floating-point or signed integer files. Credits: Ernie Wright (USRA), Noah Petro (NASA/GSFC).

Regular checksums (in MD5 or SHA256) provide a way to verify the package integrity, i.e., the package has not been \u0026lsquo;corrupted\u0026rsquo; during the download. However, they are useless to prove that the packages really come from us and have not been tampered with. To achieve this, we use cryptographic signatures via GPG by signing each package with our own personal key.\nVerify a package If you use Linux, you should be able to find your way around easily. On macOS, you can use GPGTools. If you are on Windows, you can find more information on verifying gpg signatures in the Tor Project website.\nOk, first you need to have gpg installed and working. For each package that you download from our website, for example gaiasky-package.zip, we provide a detached signature file named gaiasky-package.zip.sig. This signature is generated with our personal key. In order to verify it, you first need to import the key:\ngpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 0x448C2B189756743013D5F7C22FD2A59C1D734C1F You can now verify the signature for each file:\ngpg --verify gaiasky-package.zip.sig gaiasky-package.zip If the verification succeeded, you should see a line \u0026ldquo;Good signature from [\u0026hellip;]\u0026rdquo; somewhere in the output, like so:\ngpg: Signature made Mon 19 Feb 2024 12:46:08 CET gpg: using RSA key 448C2B189756743013D5F7C22FD2A59C1D734C1F gpg: Good signature from \u0026#34;Antoni Sagrista Selles \u0026#34; Back to downloads\n","href":"https://gaiasky.space/downloads/verifysig/","tags":null,"title":"Verify GPG signatures"}]
