This catalog is a handpicked collection of the most precise stellar measurements available in DR3, designed for applications where accuracy in parallax and astrometric fidelity is essential. This catalog includes a total of 646,400 stars, with a clear bias toward brighter magnitudes. It is a small, non-LOD (non-Level-of-Detail) catalog, designed for broad compatibility. It will be the recommended star dataset starting from Gaia Sky 3.6.8.\nIt is ideal for:\nLaptops VR Low-end desktops Devices without dedicated GPUs in general Use cases where performance and simplicity matter more than completeness Hammer projection of the new Gaia DR3 Best catalog. What does it include? The Gaia DR3 Best catalog includes:\n646,400 stars, carefully selected from the 1.8+ billion in Gaia DR3. All stars with relative parallax error ≤ 0.4% for bright stars (gMag \u0026lt; 13.1). All stars with relative parallax error ≤ 0.002% for faint stars (gMag \u0026gt;= 13.1). The full set of Hipparcos stars, cross-matched and merged into the dataset. This makes it ideal for high-precision visualization, distance estimation, nearby star studies, or any work requiring only the cleanest subset of the Gaia DR3 catalog.\nWhy another Gaia catalog? Gaia DR3 is a treasure trove, but not all stars are created equal when it comes to measurement quality. This dataset is suitable for low-end devices, and distills the most trustworthy data from the full release, eliminating sources with:\nNegative or low-quality parallaxes Non-finite magnitudes Poor astrometric solutions Here\u0026rsquo;s a breakdown of how we got from 1.8 billion stars to 646k:\nStep Count Initial Gaia DR3 entries 1,811,709,771 Rejected due to parallax (criteria + negatives) 1,805,626,704 Rejected due to non-finite magnitude 5,455,190 Final stars selected 646,400 This dataset loads fast, uses less memory, and is visually cleaner in 3D than the full Gaia DR3 catalog.\nMagnitude distribution The stars span a wide range of magnitudes, with the majority in the range 8 to 12.

In this post, we\u0026rsquo;ll take a closer look at these enhancements and how they translate into smoother and faster performance.\nMemory Usage Optimization Gaia Sky 3.6.8 introduces multiple changes aimed at reducing memory footprint:\nQuadruple Library Integration: The Apfloat library has been replaced with Quadruple, a compact 128-bit floating point library that offers sufficient precision while minimizing memory allocations. It is also much faster! Find more details in this blog post. Data Structure Refinement: Particle data holders (for particle and star sets) are now flattened into Java records, consolidating several data structures and eliminating unnecessary attributes. Memory Compaction: The PointCloudData and ParticleRecord classes have been refactored into compact records, reducing memory overhead. 16-bit Floating Point Usage: Non-critical attributes, such as star magnitudes, now use 16-bit precision, striking a balance between precision and memory consumption. Below are the heap memory usage comparisons between Gaia Sky 3.6.7 (top) and 3.6.8 (bottom):\nHeap memory usage for Gaia Sky 3.6.7 over a ~350 second session with the small Gaia DR3 dataset (~1.9 M stars loaded). Notice that the heap grows very fast and the garbage collector needs to act very often. The base memory usage sits at around 1.33 GB. Heap memory usage for Gaia Sky 3.6.8 over a ~350 second session with the small Gaia DR3 dataset (~2.5 M stars loaded). Minimizing allocations helps the heap grow super slowly, with a lower baseline of ~0.95 GB. Only two garbage collections were recorded during this session. Note the much lower profile and drastically reduced garbage collector interventions (37 vs 2) in Gaia Sky 3.6.8. Observe that the allocated memory is now roughly half of what it used to be. Also, switching to the Generational ZGC caused the GC stops to go from ~10-100 ms to ~10 μs. All this results in a higher latency, better memory utilization and more responsive experience.\nCPU Usage Reduction Several optimizations have been implemented to reduce CPU load and improve frame rates:\nCustom Data Structures: Gaia Sky now uses FastObjectIntMap and FastStringObjectMap for the indices to eliminate the overhead of generic collections. This helps avoid allocating boxed Integers and Nodes, and perform much faster lookups. Background Processing: The background particle/star updater has been re-implemented from the ground up, leading to significant CPU savings. Frame Distribution: Metadata updates and sorting operations for star/particle sets are now spread across multiple frames to prevent frame spikes. Generational ZGC: The JRE has been upgraded to version 24, utilizing Generational ZGC by default. This modern garbage collector offers much shorter pauses and reduced latency. Float-128 vs Apfloat: One of the worse hot-spots in Gaia Sky has been the arbitrary floating-point arithmetic. So far, we\u0026rsquo;ve used Apfloat. In this release, we switched to Quadruple, a 128-float implementation that performs much faster that both Apfloat and BigDecimal. Here are the CPU usage comparisons using btop for both versions:\nCPU usage with Gaia Sky 3.6.7. CPU usage with Gaia Sky 3.6.8. Note the top image shows the CPU usage of Gaia Sky at 292%. This means that it is using 3 CPUs at full (the load is distributed between the 8 CPUs). At the bottom, I stopped version 3.6.7 and started version 3.6.8. You can see in the top pane the difference in CPU usage profile (annotated in red). The CPU usage sits at about 45% with Gaia Sky 3.6.8. A great improvement. Curiously, and related to the previous section, the allocated memory in 3.6.7 sits at 6.2 GB, while it is below 3 GB in 3.6.8. The workload for both sessions was exactly the same, with the same datasets and settings.\nConclusion The performance improvements in Gaia Sky 3.6.8 not only make it more memory-efficient but also significantly reduce CPU overhead. The result is a smoother and more responsive experience, particularly for systems dealing with large datasets or multiple particle/star sets.\nStay tuned for the official release and explore these enhancements firsthand!\n","href":"https://gaiasky.space/news/2025/performance-improvements/","tags":["performance","cpu","memory","GC","java"],"title":"Performance boost in 3.6.8"},{"categories":["devlog"],"content":"We’ve just leveled up bookmarks in Gaia Sky! As of the latest update, location bookmarks are no longer limited to just camera position, orientation, and time. Now, they can also store the full settings file and the focus object — giving you a complete snapshot of your session. Additionally, on creation the user may choose what elements to persist as part of the bookmark.\nThis means that when you load a bookmark, Gaia Sky can restore not only where you were, but also how things were configured and what object you were focused on. Whether you’re setting up a custom visualization, preparing a presentation, or just exploring the cosmos, your environment can now be fully restored with a single click.\nWhat’s more: all bookmark fields (except for the name) are now optional — you can selectively store in your bookmark only what matters to you.\nThe new location bookmark dialog allows for the selection of the elements to persist. To learn more, check out the Bookmarks documentation.\nThe new feature will make it into the next Gaia Sky release. As always, you can already test it by running Gaia Sky from source.\n","href":"https://gaiasky.space/news/2025/new-bookmarks/","tags":["bookmarks","session","focus","settings"],"title":"New features in bookmarks"},{"categories":["devlog"],"content":"One of the items in our road map has long been the re-implementation of the speed scaling algorithm. This algorithm is a function that, given the current state of Gaia Sky, returns a number by which to scale the camera speed.\nSo far, we have used a function that only takes into account the distance to the focus object (focus mode), or the distance to the closest object (any other mode). This does not work very well in many situations. In this post, I explore the new developments in Gaia Sky that enable smoother interstellar trips by means of the camera speed scaling.\nThe problem The main issue with the current method is that its only dependency on the distance to the focus object makes it ignore all the (possibly closer to the camera) objects. We compute it like this, $$ d_s = d_f * K, $$\nwhere \\(d_s\\) is the distance scale, \\(d_f\\) is the distance to the focus, and \\(K\\) is a constant.\nPicture this: we are focused on Phobos in the Solar System, and the moon is in full view of our camera. In the background we spot an interesting star. We double-click on it to focus it, and then we click on the \u0026ldquo;Go to\u0026rdquo; button in the focus pane. With the current implementation, Phobos, Mars, and the entirety of the Solar System disappear in the first frame, because the first step towards our star focus is too large. This is because we are very far away from the star, and the speed scaling only depends on this distance. The speed is set to very high, so we are instantly thrown out of the Solar System.\nThe problem with the current speed scaling. Note how the first frame is already well outside the Solar System. How do we solve this?\nThe solution The first obvious solution is to take into account objects other than the focus. One possible solution is to compute the local density of objects in an arbitrary volume around the camera, but this is probably overkill. Another solution might be setting up the closest object to the camera with a smoothing radius, and mix its distance with that of the focus:\n\\begin{aligned} d_s \u0026amp; = mix(d_c, d_f, a) \\\\ a \u0026amp; = \\frac{d_c - d_0}{d_1 - d_0}, \\end{aligned}\nwhere \\(d_c\\) is the distance to the closest object, and \\(d_0\\) and \\(d_1\\) define the smoothing radius outer and inner bounds. When the camera is further away from the closest object than \\(d_1\\), only the focus distance is used. When the camera is closer to the object than \\(d_0\\), only the distance to the closest object is use. In between the two smoothing distances, a mix of both is used.\nThe smoothing radius (in red and green) provides a smooth transition between using the distance to the focus and the distance to the closest object. This method gives us a rather smooth transition from object to object. The camera is usually hooked to a single object, which may be the focus or the closest object. In the case that the camera is between \\(d_0\\) and \\(d_1\\) from the closest object, we mix the contributions to avoid stark transitions in speed.\nThe video below compares the old and the new methods:\nYour browser does not support the video tag. Comparison between the old method, based on focus distance, and the new method, that takes into account other objects. Transition-based trips The Gaia Sky API contains some methods to create frame-accurate camera transitions in both position and orientation. Those are smooth by design, as they can use logit and logistic sigmoid mapping functions.\nThese methods interpolate the camera state (position, direction, and up vectors) from the current state to a user-defined final state. They do so in a provided amount of time, and using the provided mapping function. They end up calling something like this:\nvoid cameraTransition(double[] camPos, String units, double[] camDir, double[] camUp, double positionDurationSeconds, String positionSmoothType, double positionSmoothFactor, double orientationDurationSeconds, String orientationSmoothType, double orientationSmoothFactor, boolean sync) Here is the documentation. For completion, the parameters are as follows:\ncamPos \u0026ndash; final camera position. units \u0026ndash; final camera position units. camDir \u0026ndash; final camera direction vector. camUp \u0026ndash; final camera up vector. positionDurationSeconds \u0026ndash; duration of transition in position, in seconds. positionSmoothType \u0026ndash; mapping function, either \u0026ldquo;logisticsigmoid\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;logit\u0026rdquo;. positionSmoothFactor \u0026ndash; smoothing factor for the mapping function. orientationDurationSeconds \u0026ndash; duration of the transition in orientation, in seconds. orientationSmoothType \u0026ndash; mapping function, either \u0026ldquo;logisticsigmoid\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;logit\u0026rdquo;. orientationSmoothFactor \u0026ndash; smoothing factor for the mapping function. sync \u0026ndash; whether to run in synchronous mode, or return immediately and run asynchronously. Smooth go-to-object API call Since we already have the goToObject(name) API call, which uses the regular speed scaling-based method described in the previous sections, I thought I would take advantage of the already implemented transitions and spin up a better go-to. I called it goToObjectSmooth(name, posDuration, orientationDuration) [API reference]. This method uses camera transitions internally, and produces a fundamentally different result than its plain goToObject() counterpart. I happen to think that produces better results in most cases.\nHere is a comparison video with both methods.\nYour browser does not support the video tag. The new goToObjectSmooth() API call produces a more pleasant trip from start to finish.

The most noteworthy addition is the introduction of the volume rendering infrastructure.\nGaia Sky 3.6.5 welcome screen. Features Add support for volume rendering. The infrastructure is in place with a new archetype Volume. This is necessary for the new volumetric aurora dataset and volume nebulae in NGC2000. Add \u0026lsquo;volumes and effects\u0026rsquo; catalog type. Enable \u0026quot;flip\u0026quot; attribute for boxes/cubes in mesh builders. Add \u0026quot;cameraCollision\u0026quot; attribute to bodies. Shader include statement now supports targets in datasets. Add on-demand re-compilation of post-processing shaders from their source files, in runtime. Add new attribute renderLabel to label component. This enables/disables the actual rendering of the label. Increase default quality of FXAA filter, provide a simpler implementation (disabled by default), and enable hot shader reloading for FXAA effect. Update Gaia Sky icon. Add Bluesky link to readme file and about page. Bug Fixes Position of context menu in dataset manager is off. Unknown dataset types crash Gaia Sky. Fixes #787. Do not crash when reloading non-compiling glsl shaders. Wrong size initialization for ray-marched objects. Prevent non-focusable objects to appear in search results and to be set as camera focus. Enable atmosphere/cloud procedural generation even when the surface is disabled due to cubemaps being used. Do not attempt setting a window icon in Wayland, it is not supported and results in a (harmless) crash. Position tracking does not work with objects in orbital elements group. Correctly populate window width and height in preferences dialog. Build System Update configuration file version number.

Fixes #719. tooltips in number validators using the MAX_VALUE or MIN_VALUE should use infinity instead. Part of #756. add orientation to shape dialog (camera, equatorial, ecliptic, galactic). Fixes #756. remove all shapes [\u0026amp; around object] actually removes all shapes and not only the first in the list. This is part of #756. default to scientific notation only when abs(num) \u0026gt; 9999. Fixes #755. possible null pointer exceptions in OpenXR driver. enable breaking string sequences at forward and backward slashes, as well as whitespaces. This prevents overflown content in the error dialog in certain cases. run actual octant update code in the main thread. particle sizing and size limits in the loader. Performance Improvements remove unnecessary synchronized blocks from index. use parallel sort instead of regular single-threaded sort for particle and star sets. make sure that unseen stars (i.e. computed final color is 0) do not take up fragment shader resources. Code Refactoring rename attributes of UCD and UCDParser to comport with the global style. Build System upgrade to gradle 8.5.

Add CLI flag to force HiDPI mode either to \u0026lsquo;Logical\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;Pixels\u0026rsquo;. Enable holding comma or period to slow down or speed up time. Map time speed up and slow down to d-pad up and down in game controllers. Add trailMinOpacity to trajectories. This raises the opacity of a trail to the given minimum value. Speeding up and slowing down time can be done by pressing and holding \u0026lsquo;.\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;,\u0026rsquo; respectively. No more frantically clicking a key. Also, the time warp change is smooth now. Add camera position/orientation named bookmarks, additionally to the already existing object bookmarks. Add bookmarks for many eclipses in the default bookmarks.txt. Use coordinates provider from objects to sample periodic orbits instead of hardcoded algorithms. Dim atmosphere w.r.t. camera, star and eclipsing body positions during eclipses. Initial support for ephemeris based on Chebyshev polynomials. Add support for VSOP2000. Add eclipses by projecting the shadow umbra and penumbra from moons to planets and vice-versa. The option to outline the umbra and penumbra is given as a checkbox in the preferences. Eclipses can be deactivated, also from the preferences window, graphics tab. Celestial sphere showcase script. Add a few showcase scripts. Scripts showing an object on a horseshoe orbit around Jupiter. Update wording on point and line styles in preferences dialog to make it more concise and clear. Use GPU lines as the default line renderer for trajectories. This results in a big performance improvement, especially when many lines are on display. GPU lines now also can use the geometry shader to render as polyline quad-strips. Use a geometry shader to generate the triangles in the polyline quadstrip renderer instead of the CPU. Performance is much improved. Add geometry shader stage (optional) to shader program provider and to extended shader program. Add alpha value to color map in the dataset highlight color picker. Adapt star cluster loader to use the new extended particle set features by default. Enable arbitrary models rendered with instancing in extended particle sets. Add extended particle sets. These support, in addition to positions, proper motions and sizes. They also can be rendered with icosahedron sphere models instead of quads. Add lazy initialization of render systems. Enable labels for regular particle sets. Improve unsharp mask shader to produce much cleaner and useful results. Remove non-instanced triangles mode (and renderers); they are a waste of memory and almost never faster than the instanced version. Use screen-aligned billboards in regular mode, and scene-aligned ones in any of the cubemap modes (360, planetarium, etc.). Add support for texture arrays in particle sets. Particle sets can now define a group of texture files taht will be applied to the particles at random. Activate v-sync by default during welcome and loading GUI (not in VR). Use busy wait to lock to the perfect target FPS, when active. Add maximum allowed distance as a hard limit, set at 50 Gpc, roughly twice the size of the observable universe.

Add arbitrary warping mesh support to distor the final image according to a warping mesh file in PFM (portable float map) format. Replace lens flare checkbox with lens flare strength slider. Enable choosing the lens flare type (pseudo lens flare, real lens flare) in the settings. Make new lens flare the default. Proper lens flare post-processing effect. Add maximum number of virtual texture tile load operations per frame to settings file, and increase its default value from 3 to 8. Use a deque instead of a queue for the tiles waiting to be loaded, and add the newly observed tiles to the head instead of the tail. Increase chromatic aberration amount in lens flare effect. Add variations of API calls concerning positions using the distance units as an extra parameter. Move archetypes definition to JSON file to facilitate the automatic generation of documentation. Move attribute map definition to JSON file, which contains the definitions of all the attributes per component, and also a description for each of them. The aim is to generate part of the data format documentation from this JSON file. Enable implementing body coordinates directly from Python scripts. Add new API calls and a full script example with data files. Expose upscale filter setting to UI via a select box in the preferences window. Add chromatic aberration shader, together with a slider in the preferences window to disable it or control the amount. Enable proper motion for single particles, fix issues with tracking. Add support for ambient occlusion sampler (standalone and with metallic and roughness channels) in PBR normal and tessellation shaders. Add (partial) support for glTF, binary glTF and embedded glTF.

Add keyboard mapping and action to multiply the camera movement speed (mapped to \u0026lsquo;Z\u0026rsquo; by default). Add actions and key bindings to toggle the camera mode and the cinematic behaviour. Support translation in Km with the \u0026rsquo;translateKm\u0026rsquo; attribute. Directly support archetype names in JSON data format, additionally to the legacy class names. Enable affine transformation support for shape objects. Support \u0026lsquo;standard\u0026rsquo; PBR attributes in OBJ loader. Add warp mesh file selector to preferences, to select the warping mesh for the new spherical mirror projection. Fix layout for file choosers in frame and screenshot locations. Add support for the spherical mirror projection in planetarium mode. Add upscale filter setting to preferences, add XBRZ upscale shader, filter and effect. Non user-prompted events (download fail, checkum error, etc.) create persistent notifications which need to be closed manually. Persistent notifications are accompanied with a close button to indicate they need to be closed manually. Add parallax demo script. Separate height scale from elevation multiplier in shaders. Decrease step of some sliders. Enable arbitrary parameter map injection in data loaders. Add fadeDistanceUp and fadeDistanceDown to trajectory objects to control the fading distances when a body is present. Add animations to all UI elements, add animation time to settings. Add in/out animations to gamepad GUI and maximize/minimize to debug and focus interfaces. Add animation time as a new setting in settings file. Promote date dialog to generic dialog. Add size attribute to ray-marching effects, enable absolute predicted positions for ray-marching effects, instead of only a static position. Add per-vertex colors (instead of per-segment) to polyline quadstrip renderer for smooth shading. Add shortcut to settings in context menu. More on input. First OpenXR test, not working on Linux over SteamVR due to unsupported swapchain formats. Add ambient level and color to individual models. Add \u0026lsquo;fixed angular size\u0026rsquo; support for star datasets. It renders all stars with a fixed angular size. In the case of variable stars, if a fixed angular size is set, the variability is expressed via the opacity. Bug Fixes Correctly initialize camera focus and mode at gamepad/VR GUI creation. Restore functionality in archive/DB information window when selecting stars. Restore functionality of location log, lost in a regression during the ECS refactoring. Star set labels respect label fading factor. Move Gaia Sky logo over the title in help window. \u0026lsquo;cancel download\u0026rsquo; catalan and spanish translation texts. Roughness and metallic colors and textures not being set correctly in wavefront loader. Look-up table paths in procedural generation window. Regression in go-to command with star and particle groups. Check for empty configuration file at startup and overwrite it if necessary. Orientation locking does not work in backwards time. Fixes #718. Bump default safe mode OpenGL version to 3.3 to support instancing. GPUs from 2007 support it, so it should be safe. Also, do not attempt to compile double-precision geometry shaders in safe mode, since they are not used and may crash anyways. Line trail mapping in non-timestamped trajectories. Fixes #715. Double-rebuilding of dataset manager on close. Also, closing the dataset manager does not persist the preferences. Shader version for normal shader from 410 to 330 to prevent crashes in old GPUs. Regression in texture binding introduced in 3.5.0-RC3 (commit 7db456cc). Adjust rotate/turn strength when using the arrow keys. Random bugs in label render system. Do not show collapse/expand buttons in collapsible windows if collapsing is disabled. Wrong key used in galactic latitude attribute in color map picker. Input multiplexer and welcome GUI initialization sequence may cause a startup crash in certain conditions. Initialization sequence for distance scale factor, and particle groups breaking in VR when using triangles. Do not skip processing of LOD-based object when it is the current camera focus. Adjust visibility and opacity determination for entities with active fade in map; mostly used for NEARGALCAT objects. Spread GPU streaming of multi-component billboard datasets over several frames. Billboard set texture array uniform setting. Pixel-perfect interaction in VR menus. Surface normal was being transformed with a matrix that contained a translation instead of only using rotations. Properly scale particle set particles in VR. Proper motions in VR mode. Interactive load of JSON datasets that contain objects with 3D models blocks main thread. Guard in getLineObject() calls with a timeout does not use the time out. Fixes #711. Scale orbit element particles for VR, readjust size limits. Slider texture filtering issue in green, blue, orange and red themes. Star surface shader crash when motion blur is on. Non-canonical OpenGL parameters in some configuration calls. Headless mode crashes on start. Star billboard and quad positions in stereo mode. Absolute position method in particle set does not guard against null parameters. Fixes #710. Dataset manager layout, especially on low-resolution displays. Move hardcoded billboard galaxy threshold to model initializer. Single star rendering from afar, spherical position determination, graph update sequence for proper motion and other objects, bypass area and loc update when components are off, camera position lock for stars in star sets. Several issues with single star rendering and magnitude initialization. Add mechanism to automatically disable certain post-processing effects on certain render modes (e.g. light glow on panorama/planetarium mode). Internal dataset loading operations out of order: move scene graph insertion before set-up. Enable model-less shape objects for label-only use cases. Removing objects with children only effectively removes the first children, leaving orphan objects in the scene graph which do not get updated but get added to the render lists. Removal of an object from the graph does not remove its children. Normals, bi-normals and tangents in icosphere creator. Crash with static light models, file filter in dataset loader. Cloud virtual textures not working due to missing shader attribute. Crash loading wrongly constructed cluster file. Trail attribute of orbits not always working. GPU non-trail orbits not working. Performance Improvements Improve performance of velocity vectors in LOD datasets by setting restrictions on the octant\u0026rsquo;s solid angle before sending the star sets to the velocity vector renderer. Remove guard clauses in shader interpolation function that are already covered by smoothstep(). Distribute SVT render pass over 5 frames to split contribution over time and achieve more or less constant frame pacing. Code Refactoring Set \u0026lsquo;useColor\u0026rsquo; in models to false by default, so that the object color is not passed to the 3D model unless explicitly stated. Remove dpendency on gdx-gltf, implement own modification which directly loads meshes using 32-bit integer indices instead of 16-bit shorts. Rename some classes to make them more concise. Fix and improve javadoc comments. Consolidate shader and resource disposing in post processors. Unify tessellation and regular shader infrastructure. Trigger star/particle set update task in updater systems instead of via the camera motion event. Shorten minimum times between metadata updates. Move particle and star set updater methods to consumers initialized at creation. Rename all math utilities converted from single to double precision from [name]d to [name]Double. Use solid angle component instead of hardcoded variables for star cluster thresholds. Move \u0026lsquo;forceLabel\u0026rsquo; attribute to Label component.

Refactoring abstract attitude loading system, remove Gaia class, use heliotropic satellite. add I18nFormatter to reformat i18n files. add source object to events by default. flatten object hierarchy by removing some classes, merging their functionality upwards. improve service thread implementation. improve shader combination and lookup (from ssr branch). move all text from -v flag to i18n keys. move double array to gaiasky.util package. move tips and funny texts to main bundle, add some dangling hard-coded strings to bundle, enable translation of keyboard keys. move update process to runnable, protect render lists from outer access. old milky way renderer converted to general-purpose billboard group infrastructure to enable representation of any quad-based point data. remove old date formatting infrastructure (desktop, html, mobile) in favor of a direct approach. remove some warnings, clean up code. remove unused and obsolete Jython fix. remove unused id from components, fix skybox orientation. remove useless number formatting infrastructure. rename u_environmentCubemap to u_diffuseCubemap in shaders. rename setting data::skyboxLocation to data::reflectionSkyboxLocation. rename some packages and move some code around. use bit mask instead of 64-bit integer as attributes mask so that we can register more than 64 attributes. Add proper 3-component specular color to materials. Add diffuse cubemaps for models and clouds. Fix a number of shader issues. Style consolidate normal shader vertex data into struct. organize imports in whole codebase.

Most importantly, we have essentially refactored the way star catalogs are handled, so that we can now stream data from disk when it is needed. Also, we\u0026rsquo;ve been working hard to make better use of the GPU and we are proud to announce that we\u0026rsquo;ve increased the performance fourfold while being able to display many more objects on screen at once.\nHere is the list of the most important enhancements:\nImplemented particle groups and star groups to optimize GPU usage Added on-demand streaming of data for LOD (levels of detail) datasets Particle/star groups integration with LOD Enabled additive blending by default New parallel view stereoscopic profile GUI refactoring to enable proper HiDPI support GUI animations Added French and Slovene languages Proper motion vectors color coded by direction and mangitude Debug info greatly improved Added Oort cloud Added Nearby Galaxies Catalog (NBG) Added some SDSS objects Added Saturn moons Added Pluto Enabled high accuracy positions as an option Implemented land on and land at coordinates functions and exposed them in GUI New target mode In free camera which scales velocity according to distance to closest object Implemented proper controller/gamepad mapping system Added invert Y axis option Reimplemented spacecraft camera mode from the ground up Network checker made asynchronous Some components\u0026rsquo; initializations moved to go through the asset manager Added non cinematic camera mode, which is now the default And here a list of the most important closed bugs and issues:\nFixed lots of bugs in scripting interface Fixed eye separation in spacecraft+stereo mode Fixed random crashes at startup Scale point primitives by ratio Fixed Milky Way texture misalignment Fixed controller input in non-cinematic mode Fixed quad line renderer artifacts Fixed label flickering Greatly improved octant detection Config file version check Back to releases ","href":"https://gaiasky.space/downloads/releases/v1.5.0/","tags":null,"title":"Release 1.5.0.68dae022"},{"categories":null,"content":" Gaia Sky 1.0.4 2016-12-07 Build c0eaeda TGZ package .tar.gzgaiasky-1.0.4.c0eaeda.tar.gz no signature DEB package .debgaiasky_linux_1_0_4_c0eaeda.deb no signature RPM package .rpmgaiasky_linux_1_0_4_c0eaeda.rpm no signature macOS .dmggaiasky_macos_1_0_4_c0eaeda.dmg no signature UNIX Installer .shgaiasky_unix_1_0_4_c0eaeda.sh no signature Windows 32-bit .exegaiasky_windows_1_0_4_c0eaeda.exe no signature Windows x86-64 .exegaiasky_windows-x64_1_0_4_c0eaeda.exe no signature Release Notes Implemented enhancements:\nimprove loading times #102. config window HiDPI mode #101. dependent visibility for orbits #100. map and calibrate Milky Way panorama #94. add option to capture frames while camera path is playing #71.

Fifth Catalog of Nearby Stars (CNS5) catalog-cns5 The Fifth Catalogue of Nearby Stars (CNS5) aims to provide the most volume-complete sample of stars in the solar neighbourhood. The CNS5 is compiled based on trigonometric parallaxes from Gaia EDR3 and Hipparcos, and supplemented with astrometric data from Spitzer and ground-based surveys carried out in the infrared. The CNS5 catalogue is statistically complete down to 19.7 mag in G-band and 11.8 mag in W1-band absolute magnitudes, corresponding to a spectral type of L8. Continuous updates of observational data for nearby stars from all sources were collected and evaluated. For all known stars in the 25 pc sphere around the Sun, the best values of positions in space, velocities, and magnitudes in different filters are presented. Type: catalog-star. Dataset version: v3.

This table contains an all-sky catalog of 869 nearby galaxies having individual distance estimates within 11 Mpc or corrected radial velocities relative to the Local Group centroid VLG \u003c 600 km s-1. The catalog is a renewed and expanded version of the previous Catalog of Neighboring Galaxies by Karachentsev et al. (2004, AJ, 127, 2031). It collects data on the following galaxy observables: angular diameters, apparent magnitudes in the far-UV, B, and Ks bands, H-alpha and H I fluxes, morphological types, H I-line widths, radial velocities, and distance estimates. In this Local Volume (LV) sample, 108 dwarf galaxies still remain without measured radial velocities. The catalog also lists calculated global galaxy parameters: the linear Holmberg diameters, absolute B magnitudes, surface brightnesses, H I masses, stellar masses estimated via K-band luminosity, H I rotational velocities corrected for galaxy inclination, indicative masses within the Holmberg radius, and three kinds of 'tidal index' which quantify the local density environment. In the reference paper, the authors briefly discuss the Hubble flow within the LV and different scaling relations that characterize galaxy structure and global star formation in them. They also trace the behavior of the mean stellar mass density, H I-mass density, and star formation rate density within the volume considered. Type: catalog-gal. Dataset version: v14.

NASA Exoplanet Archive nasa-exoplanet-archive The NASA Exoplanet Archive is an astronomical exoplanet catalog and data service that collects and serves public data that support the search for and characterization of extra-solar planets (exoplanets) and their host stars. This dataset contains all planet and host star solutions, regardless of their relationship. This includes atypical systems such as free-floating planets and those with multiple stars. This table also contains Kepler, K2, and TESS candidate solutions for confirmed planet systems, a nearly complete identification of published stellar companions, and projected and true planet obliquities. The systems in this dataset are shown with glyphs according to the number of planets in the system, and colored accordingly. When approaching a system, the glyph disappears and the actual stars and planets get loaded. Note that this dataset also includes the stars as defined in the NASA Exoplanet Archive, so if you already have a star catalog you will end up with duplicate objects. Type: system.

ESA Euclid spacecraft-euclid ESA Euclid spacecraft, with its orbit and model. Euclid is an ESA mission to map the geometry of the Universe and better understand the mysterious dark matter and dark energy, which make up most of the energy budget of the cosmos. The mission will investigate the distance-redshift relationship and the evolution of cosmic structures by measuring shapes and redshifts of galaxies and clusters of galaxies out to redshifts ~2, or equivalently to a look-back time of 10 billion years. In this way, Euclid will cover the entire period over which dark energy played a significant role in accelerating the expansion of the Universe. Type: spacecraft. Dataset version: v3.

LOLA data is archived on the Geosciences Node of the Planetary Data System. A small subset of the LOLA data stored there, the global cylindrical projections at 4, 16, and 64 pixels per degree, has been reformatted here as uncompressed TIFF files, in vertical units of either floating-point kilometers or 16-bit unsigned integer half-meters. The reference surface for all LRO data is a sphere of radius 1737.4 km. LOLA's gridded elevation data is published as signed 16-bit integers in units of half-meters relative to this radius. For the floating-point TIFFs, the source data was divided by 2000. For the unsigned 16-bit TIFFs, the source data was offset by +20,000 (10 km) so that all of the values are positive. This latter format is provided for software that doesn't work well with either floating-point or signed integer files. Credits: Ernie Wright (USRA), Noah Petro (NASA/GSFC). Type: virtualtex-pack.
